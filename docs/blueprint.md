## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant teal (#26A69A) to evoke a sense of calm, trustworthiness, and innovation, perfect for a modern clocking system. It shows you're not stuck in the past!
- Secondary color: Warm coral (#FF7043) as a contrasting accent to highlight important actions and interactive elements. This pop of color adds a friendly touch and guides the user.
- Background color: A soft, light grey (#F5F5F5) to provide a clean and spacious feel, ensuring readability and reducing eye strain during long admin sessions.
- Body font: 'Nunito', a rounded sans-serif font that feels approachable and friendly, making the interface less intimidating.
- Headline font: 'Montserrat', a bold and modern sans-serif that provides clear hierarchy and visual impact.
- Utilize a set of playful and consistent icons from a library like 'Remix Icon' or 'Tabler Icons'. Slightly larger icons with subtle animations on hover can add a delightful touch.
- Implement a modern, card-based layout with rounded corners and subtle shadows to create a sense of depth. Ensure ample whitespace and clear visual hierarchy to guide the user through the interface. Consider a dashboard with visually appealing charts and graphs to display clocking data.
- Incorporate subtle, yet engaging animations. For example, a smooth transition when clocking in/out, a playful loading animation, or a gentle ripple effect on button clicks. These details add polish and demonstrate attention to detail.
